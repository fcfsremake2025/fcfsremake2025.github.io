<p>But don't be scared Krnl is completely safe. "But then why does my antivirus and browser say it is" you may

The answer to this question is explained in detail in the next part.</p>

</h2>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-why-this-happens" class="anchor" href="#why-this-happens" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why this happens
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern
Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in
the environment it creates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But heres the catch: Dll injection isnt just used by game cheats. They are also used by
<em><em>malware</em></em>.
Due to this antivirus try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors they detect without actually
knowing what if they are safe or not.
You will usually see antivirus calling most exploits including krnl a Cryptinject.msr trojan because
of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"But then how can you prove Krnl isn't malware?" you might ask.
User trust and safety is priority at Krnl, due to this the only hidden/protected part of the Krnl
client is the dll that is injected into Roblox(This being krnl.dll).
Other than the dll Krnl client is completely unobfuscated/unprotected.
Both the Krnl bootstrapper <em><strong>and</strong></em> krnl itself's code is completely readable
using a .NET decompiler like dnSpy or DotPeek (or even just a text editor like notepad for the node
js bootstrapper).
This means that you <em>yes</em> <em><strong>you</strong></em> can look at the code that runs the
Krnl client.
Here are the links to both the bootstrapper and the main executable files source code.</p>
</li>
<li>
Executable Source</a> -- krnlss.exe</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that this isnt the exact source code as the Asyncronous Functions wont be fully
decompiled in dnSpy. However it should still give you a good idea of if Krnl is safe or not.</p>
<h4>
PARTY ANTIVIRUS
</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>To fix this issue you must uninstall any 3rd party antivirus from your system.
Such as McAfee, Norton, Eset, Kaspersky etc.
Sorry but there isnt another way of solving this issue. From my and many users experiences
excluding/disabling 3rd party antivirus is
terrible and doesnt yield consistent/reliable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once that you have uninstalled your 3rd party antivirus and rebooted your pc (Or you didnt have any to begin
with).
Its time to exclude Krnl from Windows Defender which is the default antivirus that comes with Windows 10.
To do this we recommend watching a tutorial from YouTube.
But in short all you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the virus and threat protection settings in Windows 10.</li>
</ul>

</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making sure you have all the requirements listed on the top of this guide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure you dont have any 3rd party</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>antiviruses such as Avast, McAfee, AVG etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making sure it isnt blocked by Windows Defender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running it as administrator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure its in a folder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have done all of this but you still cant see krnlss.exe or krnl.dll in the Krnl folder, bootstrapper
getting stuck at krnlss.exe.config etc.<br>
You can try downloading krnl by other means such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Downloading from wearedevs.net</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Downloading from the pinned messages of their discord server</strong></p>
</li>

</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes its safe and uploaded by Ice Bear himself. It is essentially the same thing the bootstrapper
downloads.</li>
<li>Notice how the decompiled source of it is pretty much the same as normal krnl lmfao.</li>
<li>Its one of the two official websites to get Krnl from.</li>
</ul>
<p>All you need to do to use this version of Krnl is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the rar/zip file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract to a folder excluded from Windows Defender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open krnlss.exe located inside it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you can disregard any warning that says "Roblox version is incorrect" as its not an issue.</p>

<li>Their discord invite is krnl.gg/invite.</li>
<li>To use this version:
<ol>
<li>You must extract it to a folder excluded from Windows Defender.</li>
<li>To do this see part 1.2 of this guide.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You might sometimes find yourself in this error box when you try to inject Krnl.</p>

<p>Before we try any solutions though check that you have the requirements to run Krnl (Located at the
top of this guide)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the requirements but you are still getting an error you can try these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reinstall/Repair VC Redist x64/x86 2015-2019</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinstall Roblox</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the latest version of Krnl</p>

<li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>This error is caused by the included injector that comes with krnlss.exe being not very good.</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve this issue you need to use a 3rd party injector such as Extreme Injector
or the built-in dll injection functionality of other software such as Process Hacker.</p>
<p>We recommend watching a YouTube tutorial on how to do this. Heres a link to one made by me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QzXe2Jr_y0" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> But here's a quick
rundown of the basic steps involved.</p>
<p>After injecting all you need to do is getting a key.
How to do this can be found in step 3.
After you enter your key in it and press enter.
It should automatically close the console window
and the "Inject" button in the Krnl UI should turn into "Injected"</p>

C drive is excluded from Windows Defender try downloading Krnl zip/rar version talked about in step 1.3.

<li>If after downloading and extracting the zip/rar version you are still missing krnl.dll then its
confirmed to be an antivirus issue.

<p>Krnl Keys are based on your IP. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot share your keys with others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you decide to use a VPN when using Krnl it has to be a desktop VPN and not a browser extension
VPN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your key will be invalidated if your ip changes
(meaning if you turn your pc off for an extended period of time or reboot your router your key will
get invalidated)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a key you must go to the URL that is given to you in the console popup window after you inject krnl.
</p>
<p>This URL being: <a href="https://cdn.krnl.gg/getkey.php" rel="nofollow">https://cdn.krnl.gg/getkey.php</a>
</p>
<p>After you go to it for the first time you should be redirected to a linkvertise link.
If you get prompted to do a survey just click on the x.
Then click on free access with ads.
Do the tasks and move onto the next link.
Now do this 4 more times.
And you will finally be directed to the keypage where you can copy your key and
paste it into the console window from before then press enter.</p>
<p>It should check your key for a few seconds then the console window should disappear and krnl should be
injected.</p>

<p>This issue is actually the stuck at waiting for Roblox issue but camouflaged. Its caused by one of
the hooks that are made by Krnl at injection overwritten by another application eg. Msi Afterburner.

<p>To fix this close all apps running in the background (<a href="813881592091115600/unknown.png" rel="nofollow">Check the system app tray!</a>) and reopen Roblox then try injecting Krnl again.
